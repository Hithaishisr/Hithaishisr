## 👋 Hey, I'm Hithaishi S R

Aspiring **VLSI Design & Verification Engineer** currently sharpening my skills at **Maven Silicon**.  
With a foundation in **Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering**, I'm diving deep into the world of chip design and digital verification — and loving every moment of it.

My toolkit includes **Verilog**, **SystemVerilog**, and **UVM**, along with industry-standard tools like **Synopsys Design Compiler** and **Siemens QuestaSim**.  
But I don't stop there — when I'm not working on RTL and testbenches, you'll find me tinkering with **ESP32**, building IoT systems, and bringing hardware-software ideas to life.

### 📌 Projects
Check out some of the things I've built:

- 🧮 **[Router 1x3 Digital Logic Design](https://github.com/Hithaishisr/Router-1x3)**  
  Designed using Verilog in Xilinx ISE with Linux automation — a clean example of digital switching logic.

- 🔌 **[IoT-Based Smart Home Automation System](https://github.com/Hithaishisr/IoT-Smart-Home-Automation)**  
  ESP32-powered automation system featuring touch control, Bluetooth app, solenoid smart lock, and motor control.
