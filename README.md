## 👋 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Hithaishi S R**, an aspiring **VLSI Design & Verification Engineer** currently training at **Maven Silicon**.  
I began my journey with a **B.E. in Electronics & Telecommunication**, which built my fundamentals. Now, I’m leveling up with hands-on experience in **RTL Design**, **Verilog**, **SystemVerilog**, and **UVM**, using tools like **Synopsys Design Compiler** and **Siemens QuestaSim**.

Outside the VLSI world, I love working with microcontrollers like **ESP32**, playing around with **Bluetooth modules**, and building cool stuff using **Arduino IDE**, **Xilinx ISE**, and circuit design tools like **Proteus** and **LTSpice**.

### 💡 Interests
- VLSI Design & Functional Verification
- RTL Coding, Testbenches, and UVM
- Embedded Systems & IoT Projects
- Cycling through ghat roads 🚴‍♂️
- Solving real-world problems with code + hardware

### 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages**: Verilog, SystemVerilog, C/C++, Embedded C
- **Tools**: Synopsys, QuestaSim, Xilinx ISE, Arduino IDE, Proteus, LTSpice
- **Tech**: RTL Design, UVM, ESP32, HC-05, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Serial Communication

I'm all about **learning by doing**, and I’m excited to contribute to real-world projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in VLSI and embedded systems.
